- **Batch Strategy**: Buy smaller loaves more frequently

### "It's too expensive"
- **Cost Reduction**: Focus on whole foods over processed items
- **Bulk Buying**: Share bulk purchases with friends/family
- **Generic Brands**: Use PAK'nSAVE Pams and store brands
- **Seasonal Shopping**: Buy produce when in season
